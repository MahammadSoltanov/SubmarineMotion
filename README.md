# 🌊 Submarine Buoyancy Visualizer

## 📝 Description
A simple beginner-level desktop simulation built with WPF and C#, demonstrating the vertical movement of a submarine as it adjusts buoyancy. Inspired by a university task, this project helped me combine mathematical modeling with UI development — and sparked my interest in physics-based visualization tools.

## 🧠 Key Features
- Visual simulation of submarine rising behavior  
- Input parameters for depth, mass, and water pressure  
- Real-time position updates on UI  
- MVVM pattern (basic level)  
- Emphasis on user interaction and feedback  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- WPF (.NET Framework)  
- C#  
- MVVM (lightweight implementation)  
- XAML for UI  

## 🤔 Notes
This project was originally developed as a university task, but I expanded and polished it to better understand WPF architecture and interactive physics simulations. It stands out as a creative blend of frontend and logic in a non-web context.

## 🚀 Getting Started
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourrepo/submarine-project
# Open in Visual Studio and run
